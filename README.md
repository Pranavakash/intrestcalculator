# Simple Interest Calculator

This repository contains a simple interest calculator implemented in [your language of choice].

## 📌 Formula
Simple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount
- **R** = Rate of interest (per annum)
- **T** = Time (in years)

## 🚀 Example
If P = 1000, R = 5%, T = 2 years:

SI = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

So, the interest is **₹100**.

## 💻 Usage
You can implement this calculator in any programming language.  
For example, in Python:

```python
def simple_interest(principal, rate, time):
    return (principal * rate * time) / 100

print(simple_interest(1000, 5, 2))  # Output: 100
